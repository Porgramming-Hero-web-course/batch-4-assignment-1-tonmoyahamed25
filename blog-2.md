Handling Async Operations with Async/Await in TypeScript

In TypeScript, async/await makes handling assynchronous operations cleaner and more readable compared to callbacks or promisses.

What is async/await?
async: Declares an assynchronous function that returns a promise.
await: Pauses the function execution until a promise resolves.
Example:
 
async function fetchData(url: string) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}
fetchData('https://api.example.com/data');


Benefits:
1. Cleaner Code: Avoids .then() and nested callbacks.
2. Error Handling: Uses try/catch for better error managment.
async/await simplifies assynchronous operations, making your code more readable and maintainable.
